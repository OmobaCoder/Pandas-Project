Shopify is a popular e-commerce platform that enables businesses to sell products and services online. In this project, we'll be exploring a dataset from Shopify that contains information about online stores and their order data. The dataset provides a wealth of information that can be used to understand consumer behavior, sales trends, and business performance.

## Data Exploration: Understanding the Shopify Dataset

The Shopify dataset is a collection of data that provides information on various features such as order ID, shop ID, user ID, order amount, total items, payment method, date, time order, and item count. Let's dive deeper into each of these features to better understand the data.

### Order ID
The order ID is a unique identifier assigned to each order placed on the Shopify platform. This feature helps in tracking and managing orders, and is useful for customer support.

### Shop ID
The shop ID is a unique identifier assigned to each shop on the Shopify platform. This feature helps in identifying the shop from which the order was placed.

### User ID
The user ID is a unique identifier assigned to each user on the Shopify platform. This feature helps in tracking and managing customers, and is useful for customer support.

### Order Amount
The order amount is the total amount paid by the customer for the order. This feature helps in determining the revenue generated by each order.

### Total Items
The total items feature is the total number of items purchased in an order. This feature helps in determining the average order size.

### Payment Method
The payment method feature is the mode of payment used by the customer for the order. This feature helps in identifying the most commonly used mode of payment.

### Date
The date feature is the date on which the order was placed. This feature helps in analyzing the sales trend over time.

### Time Order
The time order feature is the time at which the order was placed. This feature helps in identifying the most active hours for placing orders.

### Item Count
The item count feature is the total number of items in an order. This feature helps in determining the average number of items purchased per order.

After exploring the Shopify dataset, we discovered that some of the tables contained outliers that required data cleaning before proceeding with the analysis. Outliers are data points that lie far away from the other data points and can have a significant impact on the analysis. By removing the outliers, we can obtain more accurate and reliable insights from the data.

## Question 1: Analyzing the Average Order Value (AOV) for 100 Sneaker Shops on Shopify
As a data analyst at Shopify, I was given a problem to analyze the average order value (AOV) for 100 sneaker shops on the platform. Each shop sells only one model of shoe and we want to evaluate the data over a 30-day window.

# Problem Statement
When the orders data was analyzed using a naive approach, the calculated AOV was found to be $3145.13. However, given that these shops are selling relatively affordable items, something seemed wrong with the analysis. As a data analyst, I needed to figure out what could be wrong with the calculation and suggest a better way to evaluate the data.

## Possible Issues with Calculation
There could be several issues with the naive approach of calculating AOV. Some of these issues are:

- Outliers: There could be some extreme values in the data that are skewing the AOV.
- Sample Size: The sample size of the data could be too small or too large, leading to inaccurate results.
- Variation in Shoe Prices: While each shop sells only one model of shoe, there could be variation in the prices of the shoes sold by different shops.

## Evaluating the Data
To better evaluate the data, I suggested calculating the median instead of the mean. The median is a better metric for evaluating the central tendency of the data in the presence of outliers. Additionally, I recommended segmenting the data by shop and analyzing the AOV for each shop separately.

## Metrics and Values
The metric I would report for this dataset is the median order value (MOV) for each shop. The median order value for a shop would be calculated by taking the median of all the orders placed on that shop over the 30-day window. This would give us a better understanding of the typical order value for each shop.

**The value of the median order value for each shop would depend on the individual shop's pricing strategy and the demand for their product. By analyzing the MOV for each shop, we can identify shops that are performing exceptionally well or those that might need some attention to improve their sales.** 



## Question 2:
 For this question youâ€™ll need to use SQL. Please use queries to answer the following questions. Paste your queries along with your final numerical answers below.
- a. How many orders were shipped by Speedy Express in total?
- b. What is the last name of the employee with the most orders?
- c. What product was ordered the most by customers in Germany?
